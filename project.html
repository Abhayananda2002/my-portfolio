            <b>– AXI Protocol Verification using UVM — Tools: QuestaSim</b>
            Developed UVM testbench for verifying AXI protocol functionality. Verified burst types: Fixed, Increment, Wrap, out-of-order
            transactions. Wrote assertions and covergroups.

            <b>– Synchronous FIFO Testbench (SystemVerilog) — Tools: QuestaSim</b>
           Verified synchronous FIFO with checkers for full, empty, overflow, and underflow. Added coverage points and assertions
        </p>

            <b>– Asynchronous FIFO Verification using UVM — Tools: QuestaSim</b>
           Validated dual-clock asynchronous FIFO using TLM modeling, coverage, and checkers. Achieved 90% coverage
